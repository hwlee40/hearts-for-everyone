# Hearts for Everyone!

Hearts for Everyone is a silly project made to share hearts with people on the internet. It's also a super cool filter (looking to hopefully implement it as some kind of camera filter in the future)!

## How does it work?

Super simple! I used google's web-based machine learning model [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and trained it to recognize two classes: idle and hands up. I took the model into [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and applied a pixel array to the webcam to assign to the hands up class. And voliÃ ! Hearts for everyone ðŸ’–.
